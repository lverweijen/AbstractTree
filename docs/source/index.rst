Welcome to AbstractTree's documentation!
========================================

Trees are very common data structure that represents a hierarchy of common nodes.
This package defines abstract base classes for these data structure in order to make code reusable.
It also provides an ``astree`` adapter in case it's not possible to inherit from any of these classes.
Finally, it provides many exports that even work on objects that don't inherit from any of the abstract base classes.
